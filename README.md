Running a MERN app locally
To run a MERN app locally, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.

# Clone or download the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-mern-app.git](https://github.com/MohdTalib-twenty/Emitrr-Assignment.git)

# Navigate to the root directory of the repository
cd your-mern-app

# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev

# Start the client
cd client
npm run dev
The server will be running on port 8000 and the client will be running on port 3000. You can access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Deploying a MERN app to production
To deploy a MERN app to production, you will need to use a hosting provider that supports Node.js and MongoDB.

Build the server:
npm run build
Deploy the server code to the hosting provider.

Build the client:

cd client
npm run build
Deploy the client code to the hosting provider.
Once the server and client code have been deployed, you can access the app at the URL provided by the hosting provider.

Additional notes
If you are using a different database than MongoDB, you will need to update the server code accordingly.
If you are using a different front-end framework than React, you will need to update the client code accordingly.
You can use a tool like Heroku to deploy your MERN app to production.
Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble running or deploying your MERN app, please check the following:

Make sure that you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.
Make sure that you have installed all of the dependencies in the repository.
Make sure that you are running the server and client code on the correct ports.
Make sure that you have deployed the server and client code to the correct locations.
